# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## W1

### Activity 1
The advice that our table decided on was to find helpful resources online when you're stuck such as youtube and online documentation.

### Activity 2

1. 10
2. 2
3. Print "Hello World" to the console every frame
4. Monobehaviour
5. When the game is first loaded, print "x = 10" to the console. 
6. The method PrintMessage has one parameter, an integer x, and 10 is the passed in argument in this case. The purpose of "x = " + x is to print out x = [the actual value of x passed in as the argument], since whatever is in the "" is counted as a string, the x inside the "" doesn't actually refer to the value 10 passed in, while the x outside of the "" refers to the value 10, and then append it to the string through addition, then finally the Debug.Log prints out the x = 10 to the console. 
7. Translate is not called on an actual object, but a class.
8. _playerTransform

I believe I finished all the features needed for minigame 2: player jumping while on the ground, coin spawning at random intervals, coin destroying on player contact and UI updating, coin destroys itself after a set amount of time.
